# Etch-A-Sketch

Solution to [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Etch-A-Sketch [Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). It includes the Extra Credit tasks of randomizing color, and darkening a cell by 10% every time it is hovered. The difference in this solution is that instead of making the cell black after 10 hovers, it instead maximizes the opacity of the cell to show the real color of the cell.
